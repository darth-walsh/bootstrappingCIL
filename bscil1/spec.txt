BootStrappingCIL1 Specification

bscil1 is a binary file of CIL assembly.
While not an instruction language, this language is an intermediate to more human-readable forms.

Its primary purpose is to handle the PE-file format, enabling pure CIL programs to be written.
Programs can only be 0x5010 bytes long.

The grammar is:
<START> : <OP> <START>
        :

<OP>    : (a CIL operation byte with any following bytes as needed)

examples of valid programs:

trivial program (just returns)
    <2A>
    ret
    
better program (push two numbers, add, write, then returning)
    <1F> <30>   <1B>     <58>   <28> <02> <00> <00> <06>   <2A>
    push 0x30   push 5   add    call write to output '5'   ret

Three custom methods are available to call.
int read() 0x06000001
Returns the next byte from standard input, or -1 if there are no more bytes.

void write(int b) 0x06000002
Writes the given value as a byte to standard output.

void finish() 0x06000003
Writes a number of null bytes until 0x52D0 bytes have been printed.
After this call, the next bytes of the physical CIL metadata ends up at the expected address.
