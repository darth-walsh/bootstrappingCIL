BootStrappingCIL2 Specification

BSCIL2 is a text file of modified CIL assembly.

The primary goal of the language is to be self-documenting. Two features will allow for that.

First, BSCIL won't have any binary characters. 
Binary files don't allow for easy code review in git, so every character in the files needs to be in ASCII.

Second, BSCIL will allow for comments.
